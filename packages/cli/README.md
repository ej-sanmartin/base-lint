# base-lint CLI

`base-lint` scans your repository for usage of modern Web Platform features and evaluates them against the Baseline dataset. Use it locally or in CI to make sure new features ship with fallbacks.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18.17+ or 20.x LTS.** The CLI depends on built-in `fetch` when creating GitHub check runs and sticky pull request comments, which is only available in maintained Node 18+/20 releases.【F:packages/cli/src/commands/annotate.ts†L94-L123】【F:packages/cli/src/commands/comment.ts†L80-L118】
- **Git available on the `PATH`.** Diff mode shells out to `git diff`/`git merge-base` to decide which files to analyze.【F:packages/cli/src/git-diff.ts†L1-L63】
- **TypeScript compatibility.** `base-lint` relies on `@typescript-eslint/typescript-estree` to parse TypeScript and JavaScript sources. The CLI suppresses the parser's unsupported TypeScript version banner by default, but effective compatibility remains tied to the versions that `@typescript-eslint/typescript-estree` supports. Using newer or older TypeScript releases may lead to parsing errors until they are adopted by the upstream parser.【F:packages/cli/README.md†L9-L15】

## Installation

Install the CLI as a development dependency with your package manager of choice:

### npm

```bash
npm install --save-dev base-lint
```

### pnpm

```bash
pnpm add -D base-lint
```

### Yarn

```bash
yarn add --dev base-lint
```

Run `npx base-lint --help` (or the package manager equivalent) for the full flag list.

## Usage

### `base-lint scan`

Analyze your repository (or just the current diff) and emit structured reports.

```bash
npx base-lint scan --mode=diff --out .base-lint-report
```

By default the CLI outputs to `.base-lint-report/` in the current working directory. Every run writes `report.json`, `report.md`, and `meta.json`, then prints the folder location to stdout.【F:packages/cli/src/commands/scan.ts†L23-L48】 The Markdown report includes a status summary and a table of findings that you can link from PR descriptions or surface in GitHub comments.【F:packages/cli/src/core/reporters/markdown.ts†L1-L36】

### `base-lint enforce`

Gate your CI workflow based on the JSON scan results.

```bash
npx base-lint enforce --input .base-lint-report/report.json --max-limited 0
```

`--max-limited` defaults to `0`, so the command fails if any Limited findings remain. Set `--fail-on-warn` (or configure `treatNewlyAs: "error"`) when Newly findings should also block merges.【F:packages/cli/src/commands/enforce.ts†L11-L35】

### `base-lint annotate`

Create or update a GitHub Check run with inline annotations from the scan.

```bash
npx base-lint annotate --input .base-lint-report/report.json
```

The command detects `GITHUB_TOKEN`/`GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`, and `GITHUB_SHA` to decide whether it can contact the GitHub Checks API; when any of them are missing (for example, when running locally) the command exits quietly.【F:packages/cli/src/commands/annotate.ts†L12-L66】 In pull-request workflows, it skips forks for safety and uploads annotations in batches of 50 by default.【F:packages/cli/src/commands/annotate.ts†L67-L142】 The resulting Check run links back to the Markdown table generated by `scan`, making it easy to jump into detailed findings.

### `base-lint comment`

Maintain a sticky pull request summary comment that mirrors the Markdown report.

```bash
npx base-lint comment --input .base-lint-report/report.md
```

The CLI reads the Markdown file, looks for `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`, and `GITHUB_EVENT_NAME`, and only posts to pull-request events to avoid noise on other triggers.【F:packages/cli/src/commands/comment.ts†L10-L48】 Existing comments containing the `<!-- base-lint-sticky -->` marker are updated in place; otherwise a new comment is created.【F:packages/cli/src/commands/comment.ts†L12-L76】

## Configuration

- **`base-lint.config.json`** – Optional configuration file resolved from the repository root (or the path you pass to `--config`). Use it to set defaults for scan mode, failure thresholds, suppressions, and path include/ignore lists.【F:packages/cli/src/config.ts†L24-L83】
- **`.base-lintignore`** – Optional ignore file that uses `.gitignore` semantics and is merged with the built-in ignore list (`node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `*.min.js`).【F:packages/cli/src/config.ts†L41-L71】

Configuration files override the CLI defaults, and direct flags always win over configuration. For full option descriptions and additional examples, see the [Base Lint configuration guide](../../README.md#configuration).【F:README.md†L41-L68】
